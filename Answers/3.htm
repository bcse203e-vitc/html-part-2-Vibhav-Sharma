        <li><h5>Simple To-Do List App:</h5> This project involves creating a web application (using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) where users can add, check off, and delete tasks from a list. It's a great way to practice fundamental front-end web development concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage (to persist data even after page refresh).</li><br>
        <li><h5>Basic Calculator:</h5> Build a calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). This project will help you solidify your understanding of JavaScript's mathematical operators, event handling, and potentially, string manipulation (to handle user input).</li><br>
        <li><h5>Simple Quiz App:</h5> Create a quiz app that presents users with a series of multiple-choice questions. The app should keep track of the score, and at the end, display the results. You can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this. This project is great for practicing working with arrays, objects, conditional logic, and potentially, incorporating timers. You can add features like storing high scores using local storage.</li><br>
